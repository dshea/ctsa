title: "Small Boat Mess About 2019"
---

This year saw another good turnout for this popular event. The weather
cooperated with low humidity, comfortable temperatures, and 8-10
kts. of wind. After an early lunch, we boarded the small craft and
spent several hours circumnavigating St. Helena's Island and just
messing about. Following that, there was a lively discussion of boat
construction and past cruises. Someone suggested having another
gathering before winter descends. Stay tuned!

"The Great White Fleet"

Can you imagine a more picturesque day?  The
weather was really quite incredible for early August and we had some
incredible vessels to play with.

First to launch was the “Whitehall” row boat.  If you look at her from the correct
angle, you can imagine where the inspiration for the wooden boat emblem came from.

Next was a canoe with traditional lines.  Don't be fooled, this
incredibly light fibergass hull has a modified carbon fiber surfski
seat that lowers the paddler's center of gravity to a nice stable position.

Launching the GP14 "ALBATROSS" was tricky, so I convinced others to row while
I handled the tiller.

Here we see the acorn dinghy "MORGAINE" executing a tack.
 
![sailors](DSC_7020.jpg)
Yes, the sailors had their work cut out for them trying to keep these
small boats on their feet with the gusty conditions.  Look at the concentration!

![chase boat](DSC_6996.jpg)
No regatta is possible without a proper chase boat and "HANSIE" did a
great job.

Somehow we all made it back to shore after circumnavigating St. Helena’s Island.
