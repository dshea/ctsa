title: "Dock Space in Annapolis"

Greetings to all my Classic Wooden Sailboat Race & Rendezvous friends!
 
Lee Tawney (former Executive Director of NSHOF & current Executive Director of the Annapolis Waterfront & Sailing Center) asked me to forward an invitation to dock your classic wooden sailboat at the Annapolis Waterfront & Sailing Center this summer (through the month of September).  He recently got permission from the State of MD for the Sailing Center to use both sides of the long pier at the old NSHOF location.  The new Sailing Center unfortunately doesn’t have access to the entire basin (like NSHOF did), and BULL & BEAR are taking up the north side of the per, but the new agreement with the State is still very helpful opportunity. 
 
Lee wants to demonstrate a steady use of the pier in the same manner NSHOF utilized the pier, so you’d be helping him, and the new sailing center, quite a bit by docking there sometime this Summer.  Just as with NSHOF, there are no docking fees, just a willingness, to allow visitors to admire your beautiful classic boat as they stroll by on the dock.  If you’re interesting in participating, or have any questions, please contact Lee at lee.tawney@discoverawsc.org.
 
Thanks all,
 
Tom Gahs
